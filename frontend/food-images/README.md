# Food Images Directory

This directory contains images for the food items in the nutrition database.

## How to Change Images

1. Simply replace any image file with your own image
2. Make sure to keep the same filename
3. Images should be square and ideally 128x128 pixels
4. PNG format with transparent background works best

## Image Naming Convention

Images are named after the food item they represent:
- apple.png
- banana.png
- etc.

No need to modify any code when replacing images - the app will automatically use your new images.
